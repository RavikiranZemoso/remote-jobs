# Onna

## Company blurb

We launched Onna to solve one of the monumental data challenges of our time: how to make everybody's proprietary information accessible, useful, and private. Large organizations use on average 175 apps for daily work tasks. But as these apps proliferate, they easily become separate, siloed stores of data. Our biggest goal is to help business and IT leaders make sense of the vast amounts of information in their organizations and turn that information into knowledge.

We believe that software should allow us to be productive and knowledgeable with significant competitive advantage to be gained for those that can achieve both. We also believe that the ability to secure your own data and keep it private, should be guaranteed at all times.
